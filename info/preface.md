**preface**

algorithm has become a common word known by many people today under a variety of
	... of different contexts
		they are important and found everywhere
the book suggest the reader should understand algorithms as a citizen of the world
	once educated on algo's the reader can educate others on them and the
		...importance of them
the preface suggests this book is a comprehensive introduction to the world
	...of algorithms
		many analysis of different algorithms (algos) are layed out
			some of the algo's are simple
				some of them are not so much
each chapter will cover...
	- an algorithm
	- a design technique
	- an application area
	...or a related topic
		the algos are in english with pseudocode or PS
			there are 231 figures for figurin'
				efficiency is generally emphasized for design criteria
					... with careful analyses of the of the running times (run-times)
						... of algos
this text is primarily at an college undergraduate to graduate level in algos and
	...data structures
		it is equally suited for self-study by technical professionals
			
**for teachers...**

this a versatile and complete book that can be useful for many courses
	... from undergrad in data structures up to graduates courses in algos
		material can be specifically selected for specialization
a course can be organized just around specific needed chapters
	the chapters have been relatively self-contained
		... so each one is relatively independent of the others
	contained is 931 exercises, and 162 problem
		each section ends with exercises, and each chapter has a set of
			... problems to solve
				some are self check thought exercises
					others are substantial homework level exercises
						...often consisting of several parts that lead
							... students through the steps for
								... solving
see http://mitpress.mit.edu/algorithms for more
	the starred sections and exercises are more suitable for graduates
		a starred section is not necessarily more difficult but it may require
			... more understanding of more advanced maths

**for students**

this book is an enjoyable (hopefully) introduction to the field of algos
	the writers tried to make the algos as accessible as possible
		to help, each is described step by step
			careful explanations are also provided of the mathematics
since this is a large book your class will probably cover only a portion of
	...it's material
		although the writers hope it'll be helpful as a course textbook
			what are the pre-requisites for reading
				-programming experience
				-math experience (some calculus level stuff)

**to the professional**

this is an excellent self-contained hand-book
since most of the algos discussed have great practical utility
	... the writers address implementation concerns and other issues
		the writers provide alternatives to a few algos that are primarily
			... of theoretical interest

**to the colleagues**

there is an extensive bibliography and pointers to the current literature
	... each chapter ends with a set of chapter notes that give historical details
		the chapter notes do not provide a complete reference
			although this is a large book, it is not enough to cover the entire field
there have been many requests for solutions and the writer's have chosen not to
	write references for them...
		this removes the temptation for students to look up a solution rather
			than solve it for themselves

**changes for the fourth edition**

not covering this as I personally have not read the third one
	there is some documentation saved on the laptop this was written on about it
		as well as an additional file covering all the errata covered before

**website

above was a url to the website and it has
	-python implementations
	-jokes
	-and other content
	-mucho stuff that may or may not be of use
