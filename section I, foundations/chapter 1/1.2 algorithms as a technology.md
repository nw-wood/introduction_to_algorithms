algos are important even in cases of infinite resources
	additionally it's still fun to find the best solution to problems

if computers were infinitely fast any method to solve a problem would do

time is a precious resource

***efficiency***

different algos that solve the same problem can be dramatically different
	... for a variety of reasons including hardware limitaitons

in ch 2 insert sort and merge sort are introduced
	insert takes cn2 to compute
		merge sort takes cnlg(n) to compute
			insert sort typically has a smaller constant factor than merge sort
				c1 < c2
					constants have less impact than dependence on n input size
						insertion: c * n * n vs merge: c * n * lg(n)
							merge sorts factor of n is smaller
								insert faster for small inputs
									merge sort faster for larger ones

ex; a very fast computer running insert sort will be beaten by a slower one running merge
	sort eventually given an infinite size of n

***algorithms and other technologies***

the above example explains why algos are important, like computer hardware,
	... as a technology
		total system perf depends on choosing efficient algos
			advances made with tech is made with algos as well

importance in fields
	computer architechture
	guis
	oos and oop systems
	integrated web tech
	fast networking
	machine learning
	mobile devices

many many things depend on algos
	there are a lot of examples

problem solving and task complexities become more accessible when
	...we are able to design better and more efficient algorithms
		... as seen above it is at larger problem sizes that the differences matter

solid base in maths and algo knowledge is what defines a skilled programmer in
	...many cases
		the more you have experimented with the better!
