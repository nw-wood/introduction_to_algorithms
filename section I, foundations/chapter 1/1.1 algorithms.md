algo: any well defined computational procedure that takes some value (or set)
	... as input, and produces some value (or set) as an output
		... in a finite amount of time

algos are tools for solving _well specified_ computing problems
	an algo describes the desired relationship between some input and it's ouput
		the algo itself describes a procedure to get from one to the other for all
			instances of a problem that it's designed for

ex; sorting a list of numbers in increasing order starting from a random state
	this is a super common thing to need to do

	input: (a1, a2, a3, ..., an)
	output: some permutation of the input where a1 <= a2 <= a3 and so on

	input: 3, 6, 9, 4, 2
	output: 2, 3, 4, 6, 9

the input in this example would be an _instance of a problem_
	an instance consists of the input needed to compute the problem
		(following any constraints imposed in the problem's statement)

many programs do something like this
	there are many sorting algorithms
		which is best depends on the input and problem at hand
			... additionally hardware constraints

an algo is **correct** if it **halts**, or finishes computing in a finite amount of time
	in addition it outputs a solution to the problem instance provided
		a correct algo **solves** the problem
			an incorrect algo may not do these things properly
				sometimes they can be useful although incorrect
					ex; controllable error rates and approximations

an algo can be English, or code, or hardware - the only requirement is following
	a procedure for computation

***what kind of problems are solved by algorithms?***

problems solved by algos:
	sorting the human genome with 3 billion different combinations and more
	the internet's routing and tools for optimizing communication
	goods and services online including public key cryptography
	manufacturing and commercial optimization practices including
		oil drilling location
		flight plans
		scheduling
	finding the shortest routes for travel
	part libraries of varying and potential exponential complexity
	image recognition for doctors
	compression algorithms for storing data

this is not an exhaustive list, but each presents two common traits
	they have many potential solutions with a best or most optimal solution
	they have practical applications in the real world

not every problem has an easily identifiable best solution
	with signal processing the discrete Fourier transform is used to sum a group of
		sinusoidal curves to produce the strength of various frequencies
			and the FFT is a way of solving these quickly, or fast Fourier transform
				this chapter also goes over an FFT circuit

***data structures***

the examines many data structures
	**data structures** are used to store data
		using the right structure is important for algo design
			no one case fits all exists

***technique***

this book can be viewed as a compendium of algos
	this book will teach you how to design algos alone
		it will teach you how to analyze algo efficiency
			some chapters address aspects of algo problem solving
				others address specific problems
					other chapters introduce techniques such as DaC
						... dynamic programming, and amortized analysis

***hard problems***

mostly the book is about efficient algos
	the typical measure is speed
		some problems we don't have great algos for
			these are called 'np-complete'

np-complete problems are interesting because there are no efficient algos for them
	... and nobody has proven one doesn't exist either
		secondly, np-complete problems are often similar
			...so solving one may mean solving many
				several problems are similar to problems that do have good algos
					it can be intriguing how small changes result in big changes
						... to algo efficiency

the reader should be made aware of some of these np-complete problems
	they're fairly common problems that can pop up
		it's important to recognize them so as not to avoid wasted effort
			... better to instead in these cases move on to an approximation

ex; concrete company loads trucks at a stop and has to deliver it to many spots
	the trucks gotta be back at the end of the day
		for all the trucks and all the routes what's the best setup
			this is called the traveling salesperson problem and is np complete
				there are no known efficient algos
					under some assumptions approximations can be made that
						are pretty quick however

to be more precise np-complete problems must have a yes or no answer - only decision
	problems are considered... the decision version of traveling sales problem asks if there
		is a stop order whose distance is at most a specific amount

***alternative computing models***

cpu's have limitations
	power density increases super-linearly with clock speed
		the power required in a confined space to process data increases faster than
			... the clock speed of a cpu - this means more heat in a smaller space for
				less and less performance gain
					chips are designed with multiple cores
						this is example of a parallel computer
							to get best performance we need task parallel algos

many algos in this book assume all inputs are provided at run time
	however, not all algos operate this way
		algos that are used in asynchronous environments and scheduled
			...environments where inputs must be waited upon exist
				these are also referred to as _online algorithms_
