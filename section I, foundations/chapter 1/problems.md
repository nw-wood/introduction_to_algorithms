_1-1 Comparison of running times
	a cell sheet to fill out was provided when different `f(n)` values where
		... the function could be `f(n^2)`, or `f(n!)`
			I did some math on a whiteboard for this even if it's wrong
				it got the idea in my head that different functions for factors
					... of n can cause exceptional differences in run times

	log(n) ... 1 second, 2^(10^6)... 1 century, 2^(3.15x10^15) ... GYATT DANG
	sqrt(n) ... 1 second, ~10^12... 1 century, 9.9225(10^30) ... wew!
	n ... 1 second, ~10^6... 1 century, 3.15x10^15 ... still many!
	n*log(n)... 1 second, ~200,000 1 century, ~2.2x10^12 ... 2.2 trillion runs
	n^2 ... 1 second, 1000... 1 century, 5.6x10^7 ... 36.25 million actually
	n^3 ... 1 second, 100..! 1 century, 146,500 ... oof! 3.6m actually?
	2^n ... 1 second, 20.. :( 1 century, 51.46
	n! ... 1 second, 9-10 1 century, 16-17 ... boiii I need to redo this
