_1-1 Comparison of running times
For each function f .n/ and time t in the following table, determine the largest
size n of a problem that can be solved in time t , assuming that the algorithm to
solve the problem takes f .n/ microseconds._

	log(n) ... 1 second, 2^(10^6)... 1 century, 2^(3.15x10^15) ... GYATT DANG
	sqrt(n) ... 1 second, ~10^12... 1 century, 9.9225(10^30) ... wew!
	n ... 1 second, ~10^6... 1 century, 3.15x10^15 ... still many!
	n*log(n)... 1 second, ~200,000 1 century, ~2.2x10^12 ... 2.2 trillion runs
	n^2 ... 1 second, 1000... 1 century, 5.6x10^7 ... 36.25 million actually
	n^3 ... 1 second, 100..! 1 century, 146,500 ... oof! 3.6m actually?
	2^n ... 1 second, 20.. :( 1 century, 51.46
	n! ... 1 second, 9-10 1 century, 16-17 ... boiii I need to redo this
