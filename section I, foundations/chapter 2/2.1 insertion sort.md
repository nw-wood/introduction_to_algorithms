this section covers insertion sort, an algorithm for sorting a sequence of numbers, emphasizing the relationship between keys and associated satellite data, and explaining pseudocode conventions used in described algorithms

**concept of keys and satellite data**
	-sorting is often associated with keys and satellite data
	a record is composed of a key and satellite data, and sorting moves
		both the key and associated data
	-for example; a spreadsheet of student records
		sorting could be based on a gpa
			while keeping associated data like age and...
				number of courses taken (satellite data)
**insertion sort explained**
	-insertion sort works like sorting a hand of playing cards
	-picking the first from the pile, hold it, and then insert it into the correct
		position among the previously held cards (sorted subarray)
	-the process involves comparing each card from the pile with those
		already held, starting from the rightmost card
			moving left until finding the correct position
**pseudocode for insertion sort**
	-the procedure insertion-sort(a, n) iterates through the array from index 2 to n,
		comparing each element (key) to the sorted subarray from index 1 through i-1
	-if the key is smaller than the element it's comapred against
		elemtns are shifted to the right until it's larger (correct location found)
	-then the key is inserted in the its correct position
**loop invariants**
	-the algos correctness is proven using loop invariants
	-a loop invariant is a property that holds true before every iteration of the loop
	-for insert sort it's shown that before each iteration of the consisting elements
		a[1] -> i-1 is in a sorted state
	-initial, maintenance, and termination loop understand why the algo
		...is correct and consist throughout the loop
**pseudocode conventions**
	-indentation in pseudocode represents block structure
	-loop constructs have interpretation similar to languages like c, c++, java, python
	-array elements are access using index notation
	-variables are local to procedures not global by default
	-pseduocode uses comments to indicate the remainder of the line
	-indexing schemes are chosed based on readability
		... the majority of the schemes use 1 as the origin
