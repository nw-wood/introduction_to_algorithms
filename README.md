this book is about algorithms...
lots of them ...
it is a difficult book for a new comer to just pick up, but with thorough
examination and understanding of the full contents anyone would be put
a pay grade grade higher than anyone who hasn't taken the time to
understand much of the contained information

there are many code examples for the exercise in the book converted to rust
and many answers to the exercises provided

many text transformers have been used in the process of interpretting the book
it should be assumed that by reading through these notes you will spoil the book
for yourself immediately
